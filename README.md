# Cross-Validation in Machine Learning

## Why Validation is Necessary
Validation is essential in machine learning to evaluate how well a model will perform on unseen data. It helps in selecting the best model, tuning hyperparameters, and preventing overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to new data.

## Types of Validation Practiced
1. **Hold-Out Validation**
2. **K-Fold Cross-Validation**
3. **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**
4. **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**
5. **Repeated Random Test-Train Splits**
